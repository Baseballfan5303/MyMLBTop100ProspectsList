## How you can use my code and process to make your own list!

Hello,

If you are interested in making your own version of an MLB Top 100 Prospects List but using my process as a starting point, please follow these steps:

### Making Your Own Version

On your new branch, start making your own list by:

1. Making a copy of the directory of my most recent list.
2. You can create the list by running the first Jupyter notebook file, then the entire R file, and then the last Jupyter file (for all lists after January 2023)

**PLEASE NOTE**: Keep in mind that changing column names, numbers, or lines of code may affect the "automated" process I have created.

In addition, please also note that you can contribute to the list either by helping me with my process, changing how I calculate scores, or even by sharing your own list.

### If You Wish to Contribute to this GitHub

1. First, make a fork on my repo on your own GitHub account.
2. Next, clone your copy of the repo onto your local machine.
3. Make a new branch with your username and list date (preferred).
4. Set my repo as the upstream.
5. On your new branch, start making your own list by making a copy of the directory of my most recent list.
6. Once you have made your changes and/or new version of the list, stage and commit your changes, and make a PR.

This will allow this project to be open source and should hopefully encourage collaboration so we can come up with the best version on an MLB Top 100 Prospect List.

Thanks for your interest and please reach out to me with questions! My information is on my website (https://andrewscheiner.github.io/).

Best,

Andrew Scheiner
