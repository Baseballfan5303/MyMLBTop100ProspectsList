## How you can use my code and process to make your own list!

Hi everyone,

If you are interested in making your own version of an MLB Top 100 Prospects List, please use the template in the "1-16-23" folder in this GitHub repository.

First, download all of the numbered files with parentheses. To make your own list, **please only modify the R file** so you do not effect the Jupyter file. This will keep the process automated and easy to generate a list. This way, if you have different opinions on how to weight player's skill, position, stats, etc, you can create your own list and compare with others!

This will allow this project to be open source and should hopefully encourage collaboration so we can come up with the best version on an MLB Top 100 Prospect List.

Thanks for your interest and please reach out to me with questions! My information is on my website.

Best,

Andrew Scheiner
